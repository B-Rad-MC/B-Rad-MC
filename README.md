My name is Brad McNeur. I'm a developer looking for full time work. I have a bachelor's in programming from CPIT and I've already put it to work migrating an entire, years old database using SQL. 

I've recently refreshed my skills with the courses on boot.dev, so I'm more than ready to get back into the thick of it.
